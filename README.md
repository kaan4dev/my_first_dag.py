# My First Dag Project

## Overview
This repository contains my first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) project implemented in Python. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of DAGs, including node creation, edge management, and basic traversal algorithms.

## Features
- Node and edge representation for DAGs
- Functions to add nodes and edges
- Basic algorithms for DAG traversal
